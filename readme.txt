Automatically insert/display beer recipes by linking to a BeerXML document.

== Description ==

A shortcode for linking to beer recipes.

* Link to a BeerXML document to display recipe details, style details, fermentables, hops, miscs, yeast, and notes.
* Allows you to easily switch between U.S. & Metric measurements.
* Control if & how long recipe is cached.
* Allow readers to download the recipe directly.

It follows the basic format of:

[beerxml recipe={URL} metric=true|false download=true|false style=true|false cache=-1|{seconds to cache}]

Please note: metric, download, style, and cache are optional values and have the following defaults:

* metric = false
* cache = 12 hours (60 x 60 x 12 seconds), -1 kills the cache and sets value to 0
* download = true
* style = true

== Installation ==

1. Upload the files to the `/wp-content/plugins/beerxml-plugin/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to Admin Dashboard -> Settings -> BeerXML Shortcode and configure defaults.

== Screenshots ==

1. BeerXML recipe displayed in the twenty eleven theme.
2. Inserting the shortcode into a post.
