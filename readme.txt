Automatically insert and display beer recipes by linking to a BeerXML document.

== Description ==

A shortcode for displaying beer recipes. Now with [Shortcake (Shortcode UI)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-ui/) integration!

* Link to a BeerXML document to display recipe details, style details, fermentables, hops, miscs, yeast, mash steps, fermentation schedule, and notes.
* Allows you to easily switch between U.S. & Metric measurements.
* Control if & how long recipe is cached.
* Allow readers to download the recipe directly.

It follows the basic format of:

[beerxml
	recipe={URL}
	metric=true|false
	download=true|false
	style=true|false
	mash=true|false
	fermentation=true|false
	cache=-1|{seconds to cache}]

Please note all options (minus recipe) are optional and have the following defaults:

* metric = false
* cache = 12 hours (60 x 60 x 12 seconds), -1 kills the cache and sets value to 0
* download = true
* style = true
* mash = false
* fermentation = false

== Installation ==

1. Upload the files to the `/wp-content/plugins/beerxml-plugin/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to Admin Dashboard -> Settings -> BeerXML Shortcode and configure defaults.

== Screenshots ==
